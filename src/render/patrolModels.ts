 * The patrol's own models, built by GITCRAFT's MeshCraft and shipped in public/models/: the
 * snowmobile, the helicopter and the Kessel spruce (art/3d/scripts/patrol_models.py), and the patroller
 * and Koda (art/3d/scripts/patrol_people.py).
 *
 * They replace code-built meshes, so each is modelled in the game's own coordinates (metres, +Y up,
 * forward -Z) with its moving parts on the pivots the code turns them about: named nodes for the
 * vehicles, a skeleton of the code's own joints for the patroller and Koda. Every material carries a palette role (glTF extras -> userData.gitcraft_role); the
 * vehicle meshes map each role back onto the game's own materials, so paint jobs and the storybook
 * grade work as before. If a file is missing or broken it is reported and skipped, and the code-built
 * version it would have replaced stays in place.
