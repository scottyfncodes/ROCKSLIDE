/**
 * Two small pieces of game feel for the big moments.
 *
 * Hit-stop: when the charges go off, the world slows almost to a stop for a beat, so the flash and the
 * first crack across the slab register, then eases back to full speed. Only the simulation's clock is
 * slowed; the sound, the HUD and the input run in real time.
 *
 * Haptics: a short buzz under the thumb on the blast, a hard landing and a finished job, on phones whose
 * browser can vibrate (Android Chrome and most others; Safari on iPhone has no vibration API, so there it
 * does nothing). It can be switched off in the pause menu.
